```json Response Example
{"success":true}
```

# 1. getUser function

<!-- javascript@ -->

ReadMe will provide a getUser function that takes two parameters, byEmail and byAPIKey. You should provide a function to each that returns a user in your system fetched by those two methods. This way whenever the middleware is hit ReadMe will be able to successfully find the user.

# 2. Fetch User via Email

<!-- javascript@ -->

When a user logs into ReadMe we'll make a request with their email address to get more information. This allows us to show their API Logs and API Keys directly in the documentation.

# 3. Fetch User via API Key

<!-- javascript@ -->



# 4. Return User

<!-- javascript@ -->
